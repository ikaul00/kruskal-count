# kruskal-count
MC simulation of the Kruskal count magic trick:
We explain a wonderful trick, commonly known as Kruskal’s Count and analyse variations of the same. The trick is ostensibly complicated, but upon closer inspection gives way to a simple recurring process that lies at the center of the magic. Understanding the mathematical fundamentals behind it, however, takes a bit more effort, and relies on the principles of statistics and linear algebra. It is a trick that can be performed with or without a deck of cards at a moment’s notice without any preparation. Monte Carlo Simulations are also done to compare probability of success with those obtained in literature.
